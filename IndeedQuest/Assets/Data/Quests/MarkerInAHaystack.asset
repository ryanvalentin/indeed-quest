  InstructionsText: "I need to host a whiteboarding session soon! If only there were
    some way to write on whiteboards, but i guess it\u2019s just not possible. If
    only there were some way to mark them. Some kind of marker. If only that existed. "
  WrongItemText: What? I can't mark a whiteboard with this! My whiteboarding session
    is ruined! I can't do any work at all ever again!
  QuestIncompleteText:
  - Where is the marker? No new designs can be done without that marker!
  - Please help find the marker, so this whiteboard can cease to be a blank void.
  CompleteText: Amazing! With this device I can mark the whiteboard and run my whiteboarding
    session! Thank you so much!
