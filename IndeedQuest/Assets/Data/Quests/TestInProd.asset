  InstructionsText: Dev asked for something to be added to the release after the
    branch has already been cut, and regression has already been completed! I'm trying
    to get a hotfix out by EOD! AND I found a bug, but it turns out to be a "feature".
    Will you grab me another coffee?
  WrongItemText: Uhh, this is not what I was looking for?
  QuestIncompleteText:
  - "Excuse me, do you think I'm basic? I can tell this is regular Starbucks\u2122.
    I only drink Starbucks\u2122 Reserve\u2122!"
  - No coffee, no release.
