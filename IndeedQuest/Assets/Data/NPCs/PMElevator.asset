  - Text: 'I am late to another meeting! The elevators are not working. '
  - Text: I want to a/b test elevators when they actually work
  - Text: I hate getting off the elevator on the wrong floor? Anyone ever do that...
      and then you have to turn around and face those people. I feel like I owe everyone
      in there an explanation.
  - Text: Not my day. TestStats is broken and now the elevator is broken.
  - Text: I can't believe all the meeting rooms are taken, I am now stuck here.
