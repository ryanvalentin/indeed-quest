  IdleDialogue:
  - Text: 'I''m visiting from my home planet, uh, I mean the Austin office. '
  - Text: This office pales in comparison to my planet's imperial castle. Ahem, I
      mean the Austin office.
  - Text: 'I just want you to know that I''m very much a human being and not at all
      an undercover alien. '
  - Text: Snacks...why do you humans eat them? I mean we humans, of course. Soylent
      green is so much more efficient.
